## Accounting Page Error Fix

### Issue
HTTP 500 error when loading `/accounting` page due to compilation issues.

### Root Causes Identified
1. **Improper dynamic imports**: Complex dynamic import structure was causing module resolution issues
2. **useSearchParams without Suspense**: Next.js 13+ requires proper Suspense boundaries for searchParams
3. **Circular import dependencies**: Heavy component imports were creating dependency cycles
4. **Missing error boundaries**: No graceful fallbacks for component loading failures

### Solution Applied
1. **Simplified the page structure**: Removed complex dynamic imports temporarily
2. **Added proper Suspense boundaries**: Wrapped searchParams usage in Suspense
3. **Created fallback components**: Added loading states for better UX
4. **Eliminated circular dependencies**: Streamlined import structure

### Current Status
- Accounting page now loads without errors
- Basic navigation and UI elements are working
- Ready for gradual re-introduction of complex components

### Next Steps
1. Gradually add back accounting components with proper error handling
2. Implement proper loading states
3. Add comprehensive error boundaries
4. Test each component individually before integration

### Files Modified
- `apps/frontend/app/accounting/page.tsx` - Simplified and fixed
- `apps/frontend/components/accounting/error-boundary.tsx` - Added error handling
- `apps/frontend/lib/validation/accounting.ts` - Added validation utilities
